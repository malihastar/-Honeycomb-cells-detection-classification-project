# Honeycomb Cell Detection and Classification Using Deep Learing Methods
Harvesting the honeycomb with the right methods has great importance for beekeeping activities and the country's economy. 
Failure to use the right methods in honey harvest will adversely affect both the production quantity and quality of honey.
Unconscious beekeeping activities prevent bees that play an important role in the continuation of natural life from being able to continue their offspring.
In this study, honeycomb cells were classified by using deep learning methods. As an example, a honeycomb dataset consisting of 7 classes. 
There are labeled as (open cells containing some honey(A), closed cells containing honey (B), cells containing pollen (C), hollow cells (D), 
open cells containing larva (E), closed cells containing offspring (F) and non-derived cells (E)). A total of 103451 training
and 25863 test images were created. The classification was done by 6 deep learning approaches that are includes Alex Net, Inception-v3, Vgg16, Vgg19,
Xception+Resnet, and self-structured CNN(SSCNN). As a result of the classification process the highest accuracy, 
95% accuracy for training and 94% accuracy for validation obtained.
